    """
    Configuration class for Task 2.

    This class encapsulates configuration parameters, including model details,
    market tickers, date ranges, and training settings.

    Attributes:
        model_name (str): The name of the model to be used.
        bnb_config (dict): Configuration for Bayesian optimization (or other relevant purpose).
        tickers (list of str): List of stock tickers to analyze.
        end_date (str): The end date for the data range (YYYY-MM-DD).
        start_date (str): The start date for the data range (YYYY-MM-DD).
        eval_dates (pd.DatetimeIndex): Business days within the date range.
        lookahead (int): Number of days to look ahead for predictions.
        signal_strength (int): The strength of the signal for generating predictions.
        threshold (int): Threshold for signal filtering (30% of signal strength).
        num_short (int): Number of short positions to consider.
        num_long (int): Number of long positions to consider.
        max_train_steps (int): Maximum number of training steps for the model.
